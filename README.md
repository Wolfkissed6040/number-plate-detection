# Number Plate Detection using YOLOv8

his repository contains code for detecting number plates in images using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. This project aims to provide a robust solution for number plate detection in various scenarios, including different lighting conditions, orientations, and plate types.
